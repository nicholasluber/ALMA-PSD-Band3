Do a time series analysis on the ALMA Band 3 data for the "Kolsch of Data."

The data necessary can be taken from the following Google Drive Link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U07Q-J_F4IoQzoq9tKEWL1LnzTlCm54F/view?usp=sharing

Running the current Jupyter notebook will produce a time series for the real and complex data, as well as the results from the Lomb-Scargle periodogram. The analysis does require a directory named "plots" in the running directory.
